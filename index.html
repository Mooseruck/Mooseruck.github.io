<h1> WELCOME, TO OUR WEBSITE!</h1>


<h3>This is my website! We both have our own, but are working together! :D</h3>

<p> I decided to come to code camp over the summer to learn more about
coding, or to learn it at all in general. I decided to focus on html, which,
incase you didn't know, is what web pages are made out of. Code camp
has really helped me make some new friends, including my partner to 
the right! He coded this flash game that I TOOOTALLY didn't steal
to use on my website as well, and I helped him with the html! But in general, It was a really 
fun experience that I recomend to anyone who has any interest in
learning to code computers!
</p> 

<p> Well, this is just a basic example of html coding. Have fun! </p><p>
